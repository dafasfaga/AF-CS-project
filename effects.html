        <p class="info-3"> Food waste has profound environmental, economic, and social consequences, yet continues to be a persistent problem in the U.S. Nearly 35 million Americans, including <b>10 million</b> children, live with food insecurity, while vast amounts of food are discarded each year. This waste not only exacerbates hunger but also has significant environmental repercussions. The production, transportation, and disposal of wasted food consume valuable resources like water and energy, contributing to the depletion of natural resources. Moreover, food waste in landfills generates methane, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases, which account for 11% of global emissions, accelerating climate change. As food decays in landfills, it also creates nitrogen pollution, leading to harmful algae blooms and dead zones in waterways. In the U.S. alone, the emissions from wasted food are equivalent to the emissions of 37 million cars.

      <div class="content-4">
        <p class="info-4">Food waste costs Americans over <b>$408 billion</b> each year, with the average family of four throwing away about $1,600 in produce annually, which is an astounding amount of waste. Most food waste happens in homes, followed by restaurants, grocery stores, and food companies. Farms and manufacturers also waste food, but less so. To fix this problem, we need to tackle issues like overproduction, poor planning, and habits that lead to waste, helping both the environment and the economy.
