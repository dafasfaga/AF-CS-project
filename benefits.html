          The benefits of food waste reduction are far-reaching, including improved food security and nutrition by ensuring more edible food reaches those in need. It helps combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane from landfills, and minimizes the need for agricultural expansion, which can contribute to deforestation. Financially, it saves billions globally, with households cutting costs and farmers, especially smallholders, benefiting from fewer post-harvest losses and increased income. Ultimately, reducing food waste fosters a more sustainable and equitable food system.

          To prevent food waste, everyone has a role to play. At home, people can plan meals, make shopping lists, and store food properly. Restaurants can serve the right portion sizes and track waste. Stores can teach customers how to handle food well and sell imperfect produce. Farmers and food distributors can improve how they grow, harvest, and transport food to avoid waste. Governments can help with rules, education, and encouraging food donations. Working together, these steps can reduce food waste.
